This system manages student information (studentâ€™s name, course list etc.) and course information (course name and enrollments). It supports basic CRUD operations to both students and courses info. In addition, it supports registering/dropping courses.

(Note: Since all of our team members are busy preparing the midterm exams and job interviews, we just built a draft version of the whole system. We will definitely fill things up in the next week. Thanks.)
